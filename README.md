### Project Overview
---
The objective of the project was to apply advanced data analysis techniques to derive actionable business insights. This includes predictive analytics, statistical modeling, and machine learning approaches for forecasting and decision-making.

### Data Sources
Movie Data: The dataset was provided during my internship at Victoria Solutions.

### Tools
- SQLiteStudio â€“ It was used to perform SQL queries to merge multiple datasets depending on the business questions.
  [Download here](https://www.sqlitestudio.pl/)

- Pandas â€“ It was used to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to better understand the merged dataset.

- Google Colab â€“ It was used in this project for its free cloud computing, Python support and ease of access to libraries without the need for local installation.

#### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial data preparation please, I performed the following tasks:
1.	Data loading and inspection.
3.	Handling missing values.
4.	Data cleaning and formatting.
5. 	Building the model
5.	Predicting values

   
### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the movie data to answer key questions, such as: 
1.	What Linear Regression Model can predict sales based on marketing spend and seasonality?
2.	Will a customer churn based on historical data using Logistic Regression?
3.	How does sales performance vary across different regions?
4.	What is the impact of promotional activities on sales growth?
5.	How can customers be segmented based on their spending behavior?

### Data Analysis 
```python
x = df1[['marketing_spend', 'seasonality_index']]
y = df1['total_spend']
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(x, y)
print(model.coef_, model.intercept_) 
```

### Results/Findings
The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1.	The Linear Regression Model that can predict sales based on marketing spend and seasonality was;

    **Total_Spend = 2.83â‹…Marketing_Spend âˆ’ 106.26â‹…Seasonality_Index âˆ’ 498.48**

    **For every additional unit of Marketing_Spend, Total_Spend increases by approximately 2.83 units**, assuming Seasonality_Index stays constant.

    **For every unit increase in Seasonality_Index, Total_Spend decreases by approximately 106.26 units**, assuming Marketing_Spend is constant.

  **Accuracy: 1.0**
  
  **An accuracy of 1.0 means 100% accuracy. The model correctly predicted both customer churn outcomes in the data.**
  

3.	To compare sales performance across different regions;

    Anova **P-value: 1.6512569414092805e-06**

    There is a **statistically significant difference** in total_spend across regions. At least one region has a mean total spend that's significantly different from the        others.


4.	the impact of promotional activities on sales growth;

    **Correlation coefficient: 0.9719310705137464**

    **There's a very strong positive linear relationship between Marketing_Spend and Total_Spend. This means as marketing spend goes up, so do sales.**

    **P-value: 3.4177237640332797e-10**

    **This means there is a statistically significant relationship between Marketing_Spend and Total_Spend.**



5.	Segmenting customers based on their spending behavior;

### Recommendations
- Personalized Marketing
  Marketing efforts should prioritize the high-value and medium-value groups for personalized promotions, loyalty programs, or exclusive content while cost-effective, broad-reach strategies can be used to engage the low-value segment and encourage upselling or reactivation.
- Customer Retention Initiatives
  Personalized communication by sending tailored emails or messages highlighting value-added services or offers theyâ€™ve previously responded to. 
  Offer loyalty discounts or limited-time promotions to encourage continued engagement.
  Prompt at-risk customers for feedback to understand potential dissatisfaction and adjust services accordingly.

- Targeted Offers for High-Value Customers
  Offer VIP-only discounts and early access to new products. Loyalty bonuses such as buy 3, get 1 free offer. Offer Premium support.
